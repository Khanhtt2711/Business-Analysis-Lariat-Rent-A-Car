# Business-Analysis-Lariat-Rent-A-Car

This is a profit expansion analysis using t-testing on the fiscal year 2018 transactions and company data aim to increase profit and reduce cost for Lariat Rent-A-Car, a fictional car rental business featured in TV shows such as Breaking Bad, Supernatural, Veronica Mars, Prison Break.

This project looks at 3 different strategies:

1. Increasing overall revenue by raising the price of each car rental by up to 20% in the top 5 performing branches.
  Rationale: Analysis indicates that while rasing the cost of rental car up to 20% can result in a potential 10-15% decrease in number of transactions, it still yield an overall increase in profit by at least 35%.

2. Decreasing cost of operations by paying less in insurance premium up to 20%. 
  Rationale: Analysis indicates that in FY2018, only 5% of transactions result in an accident, which means we can save more money by investing in cheaper insurance policy to reduce cost.
  
3. Increasing revenue by increasing the quota of trasactions up to 10% for the top 5 performing branches.
  Rationale: Experimental strategy to predict what would happen if we increase the transactions number by 10% (~160 more transactions for the top performing branch)
  
Within the model is also 2 interactive dashboards
  + Comparing the performance of 2 different branches
  + Comparing the performance of 2 different types of cars
  
 The Dashboard utilizes Microsoft Excel (Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, data cleaning, aggregating data, predictive modeling) and presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint (animation, transition, design principal).
